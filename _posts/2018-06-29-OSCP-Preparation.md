Reading OSCP journey and write-up always motivates me to take the PWK course and obtains OSCP certification. By writing my own journey I hope it can motivate and encourages other people that share the same enthusiasm.  Tuesday 5 June 2018, I completed PWK course registration with 60 days lab access that starts on 1 July 2018.

<b>My background</b>
<br>
As of now, I pursuing my master degree in information security and just finish up my second semester. Before continue my study on master degree, I have three years of IT professional experiences mostly in ERP, programming, and data management stuff. I have zero experiences on pen-testing, never exploit any vulnerable machines and rarely use Linux.

<b>Preparation Journey</b>
<br>
My preparation for OSCP started around September 2017. I started from the bottom, the only sort of "hacking" or exploit things I ever did was using Armitage on BackTrack for my college task, back in 2011. I never use Kali Linux before, didn't know what is bind/reverse shell, LFI, RFI, RCE and only know the theory of SQL injection but never really doing it. I do have basic knowledge on networking and programming, but If it comes to pen-testing I am totally blind.

<b>September 2017 - Finding resources</b>
<br>
At first, like any other newbies on this field, I am so clueless on where and how to start. I started with download bunch of e-books and hacking videos from YouTube. Although the e-book contains a lot of good information, I found it bored and hard to grasp the concept without actually practicing it.  On the other hand, the videos I found only showing the straight way to exploits a machine without explaining how and why. I spend a lot of time trying to find right places that suit me.

<b>October to November 2017 - VulnHub and OverTheWire</b>
<br>
I joined Facebook group <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/oscpsg/" target="_blank">"OSCP Study Group"</a> and this group helps me find the right places to start. I found two great Pen-test platform from this group which is <a href="https://www.vulnhub.com/" target="_blank">VulnHub</a> and <a href="https://www.hackthebox.eu/" target="_blank">HackTheBox</a>. On 16 October 2017, I joined HackTheBox with the help of "google" to find the entry point for getting the invite code. After getting in, I didn't know what to do, all I can do at that time was just running Nmap scan. I have no idea what to do with the information from the Nmap since I never exploit any machines before. I decided it too soon for me to start there and shifting myself to VulnHub machine to learn the methodology from the write-up.

I download these VulnHub machines: Kioptrix series, Simple, Stapler, SickOs 1.2 and Quaoar, follow the write-up and trying to understand the methodology on exploiting a vulnerable machine. I didn't and can't exploit any of them on my own. After learning the methodology, I brush up my Linux and web security basic by doing OverTheWire challenges. I did OverTheWire Bandit (1-27) and OverTheWire Natas (1-10).

<b>November 2017 to Present - HackTheBox</b>
<br>
<b>19 November 2017</b>, After feel confident enough on the basic and methodology, I went back to HackTheBox and successfully exploit "Blue" machine. The first vulnerable machine that I exploit on my own. Even though its just as simple as firing the Metasploit, the feeling is amazing and made me addicted. From that time, I spent most of my free time practicing on the HackTheBox machines.
