After completing OSCP, I went back to HackTheBox. Overall, HackTheBox is fun even though the majority of the challenges are CTF-ish. There are some challenges/machines that have real-world scenarios such as Endgame, Active and Reel which are pretty good learning places. Beside playing CTF, I think I also need to balance it with learning the actual skill that helps on a real pen-testing process. I will try the PentesterLab that well known for its web penetration testing hands-on.

PentesterLab is a platform that provides hands-on to learn web penetration testing. Before taking PWK course, I plan to try this platform but getting a payment issue at that time. There are good reviews for this platform and the price is reasonable (20$ per month). PentesterLab implements a badge system that can be obtained after completing the exercises. As of now, there are fourteen different badges that cover different areas such as Unix, Mobile Application, Networking, and Web Application. Most of the exercises are focusing on web penetration testing.

I already purchase PentesterLab Pro and my main focus will be the web penetration testing exercises. I will write the progress and the things that I learn from each exercise, so we will know what to expect from this platform.
